## Implementation Strategy

### Development Priorities

2. **Meal Planner** - High value, simpler
3. **Games Room** - Medium value, good for learning HA services
4. **Cameras** - Lower priority, performance considerations

### Technology Choices

**Locked In:**
- React 18+
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- Home Assistant WebSocket API
- Google Calendar API (direct integration)
- Lucide React icons
- date-fns or dayjs

**Flexible:**
- State Management: Zustand (recommended) or React Context
- TypeScript: Optional but recommended
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library
- HTTP Client: Fetch API or Axios
- Google Auth: @react-oauth/google or gapi-script
